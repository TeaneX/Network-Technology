## üìñ What is Network Technology?

Network technology refers to the tools, protocols, and architecture used to connect devices and systems for sharing data and resources over local and wide areas.

## üß± Types of Networks

- **LAN (Local Area Network):**  
  Small area (e.g., home, office). High speed and low latency.

- **WAN (Wide Area Network):**  
  Large geographical areas (e.g., Internet). Slower than LAN.

- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):**  
  Covers a city or large campus.

- **PAN (Personal Area Network):**  
  Short range (e.g., Bluetooth, USB tethering).

- **WLAN (Wireless LAN):**  
  Uses Wi-Fi instead of cables for LAN.

## üì° Network Devices

- **Router:** Connects multiple networks; directs data.
- **Switch:** Connects devices within a LAN.
- **Hub:** Basic device to connect network devices (broadcasts data).
- **Modem:** Connects to the internet via ISP.
- **Access Point (AP):** Extends wireless coverage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Network Components

- **IP Address (IPv4 / IPv6):** Unique device address.
- **MAC Address:** Hardware ID of network interface.
- **Subnet:** Subdivision of an IP network.
- **DNS (Domain Name System):** Translates domain names to IP addresses.
- **DHCP:** Automatically assigns IP addresses.

## üîÅ Network Topologies

- **Bus:** Single cable, simple but failure-prone.
- **Star:** Devices connect to a central switch/router.
- **Ring:** Each device connected in a circle.
- **Mesh:** Devices connected to many other devices.

## üîí Network Security Concepts

- **Firewall:** Filters traffic based on rules.
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network):** Secure encrypted connection over public network.
- **Proxy Server:** Intermediary for requests from clients.
- **IDS/IPS:** Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems.
- **TLS/SSL:** Encrypts communication over networks (HTTPS).

## üì∂ Wired vs Wireless

| Feature         | Wired            | Wireless           |
|----------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Speed           | Faster           | Slower (varies)    |
| Reliability     | More reliable    | Can suffer interference |
| Mobility        | Fixed location   | Mobile             |
| Setup           | More cables      | Easier to set up   |

## üì° Common Protocols

- **TCP/IP:** Core protocol suite of the Internet.
- **HTTP/HTTPS:** Web communication.
- **FTP/SFTP:** File transfers.
- **SMTP/IMAP/POP3:** Email.
- **SSH:** Secure remote access.
- **DNS:** Resolves domain names to IPs.

## üìà OSI Model (7 Layers)

1. **Application** ‚Äì User interface (HTTP, FTP, etc.)
2. **Presentation** ‚Äì Data format, encryption
3. **Session** ‚Äì Manages sessions
4. **Transport** ‚Äì Data delivery (TCP, UDP)
5. **Network** ‚Äì Routing and IP (IP, ICMP)
6. **Data Link** ‚Äì MAC, switches (Ethernet)
7. **Physical** ‚Äì Cables, signals, hardware

## üìå Basic Networking Tools

- `ping`: Test connectivity
- `traceroute`: Path to destination
- `ipconfig/ifconfig`: IP configuration
- `nslookup`: DNS lookup
- `netstat`: Network connections
- `nmap`: Network scanner

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Network Troubleshooting Steps

1. Check physical connections (cables, Wi-Fi)
2. Verify IP and gateway settings
3. Ping local gateway or public IP
4. Use `traceroute` or `pathping` to find slow points
5. Restart router or modem if needed
